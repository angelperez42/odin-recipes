# odin-recipes
In this project, I will create a simple website featuring some of my most-repeated recipes.

By the end of this project, I expect to have demonstrated the correct use of these skills:
    - boilerplate
    - anchor tags
    - table
    - different headings, paragraphs, and in-line changes in text
    - unordered and ordered lists
